= JBoss integration platform BOM

Bill Of Materials for SwitchYard, Drools, OptaPlanner, jBPM, ...

== Building

----
$ mvn clean install
----

== Releasing

To mimic a release without pushing any changes:

----
$ mvn clean install
$ mvn release:prepare -DdryRun
$ mvn release:clean
----

To actually release:

----
$ mvn release:prepare
$ mvn release:perform
----

Then go to https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/[Nexus] and log in.
Find your staging repository to close and release it.

=== Version numbering

This BOM has it's own version numbering and release lifecycle.
Any similarity with Drools, jBPM or SwitchYard versions is a coincidence.
