= JBoss Integration Platform Parent and BOM
:toc:

Parent and Bill Of Materials for SwitchYard, Drools, OptaPlanner, jBPM, ModeShape, Overlord, ...

== Goal

Align the dependencies of the Integration Platform projects early on in the development lifecycle.

== Building

----
$ mvn clean install
----

== Usage

The BOM may be imported into your dependency management, for example a https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/index.html#nexus-search;gav\~org.jboss.integration-platform[release version] or a https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/jboss-integration-platform-bom/[SNAPSHOT deployed by Jenkins].

----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jboss.integration-platform</groupId>
            <artifactId>jboss-integration-platform-bom</artifactId>
            <version>6.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

Any dependencies should be placed in the dependency management in jboss-integration-platform-bom. Explicit versions should not be used; instead use a property which should be placed in jboss-integration-platform-parent.

Your project should inherit:

----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.jboss.integration-platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>jboss-integration-platform-parent</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</parent>
----

By inheriting the jboss-integration-platform-parent:

* The properties used by the BOM are visible to the project.

* It inherits from org.jboss:jboss-parent:16.

* Any further plugin alignments (e.g. GWT) may be done here.


== Governance

Discussion mailing list: +jboss-integration-platform-developers+

Any project lead of the Integration Platform (IP) project can change or release the BOM as he/she sees fit,
provided that the following rules have been taken into account:

=== Adding/changing a dependency

When you want to add or change a dependency X:

. Send in a pull request (PR) with the changes you propose.

. All project leads will review the changes and *_acknowledge the PR in principle_*,
which means they have the intention to accept the change.

    ** A project lead will normally not actually test the changes on his project (as that's not practical):
    So he reserves the right to submit a pull request to revert the changes later on.

    ** Most projects do not depend on the bom's +SNAPSHOT+ directly, to avoid sudden surprises.
    Instead they depend on a released version or on a timestamped snapshot (from
    https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/org/jboss/integration-platform/jboss-integration-platform-bom/6.0.0-SNAPSHOT/[this list]).
    They then update their bom dependency's version frequently, after testing the impact locally.

    ** ACK's are done by commenting on the PR, not on the mailing list.

    ** If a project lead (or his deputy) doesn't acknowledge in reasonable time, chase him for an answer.

    ** Any project lead can reject the PR if he gives a good reason.

        *** On the +master+ branch, no PR can be rejected due to time concerns (deadlines, no time to review, PTO, ...)
        because any project/product that is about to release should be using the release branch.

. After all project leads have acknowledge the PR in principle, merge the changes.

IMPORTANT: *EAP always wins*: The BOM targets a specific EAP version.
If that EAP version already depends on X, then the BOM must use the same version as EAP.
The version properties defined in the BOM should follow pattern version.$groupId. If version.$groupId can't represent the unique version, please use version.$groupId.$artifactId.
For jboss spec artifacts, please use version.$groupId.$artifactId because there are specification versions in $artifactId.
For example:
<version.org.jboss.spec.javax.servlet.jboss-servlet-api_3.0_spec>1.0.2.Final</version.org.jboss.spec.javax.servlet.jboss-servlet-api_3.0_spec>

NOTE: The most recent and released version of EAP is available at: http://download.devel.redhat.com/released/JBEAP-6/.
During development it could be of interest to test against release candidates. These can be downloaded here: http://download.devel.redhat.com/devel/candidates/JBEAP (latest version)  



IMPORTANT: In the public bom, a dependency version must _never_ end with +-redhat-0+, +-redhat-1+, etc.
The public bom cannot depend on productization builds,
as anyone should be able to build all its dependencies from source.

NOTE: When adding a dependency and version property, the preferred format for the version property is `version.groupId`

NOTE: During conflicts, (all things being equal) prefer the latest and greatest version of a dependency in the BOM.

=== Exclusions policy

Dependency exclusions should be avoided, because they cannot be overwritten by child poms.

*A dependency exclusion is only allowed to fix an undisputed bug in the dependency's pom.*
All IP developers needs to unanimous (undisputed) to keep the exclusion.
So as soon as 1 IP developer calls for the removal of an exclusion, he/she can immediately remove it.

=== Branching policy

The +master+ branch is never released. Release are done from a release branch.
The integration platform has multiple projects, but they use the same bom.
So there are no parallel release branches. There is only 1 latest release branch.

The release branch names simply increment the minor version number.
The correlation between the bom version and project/product versions is below in the section "version mapping".

=== Version numbering

This BOM has it's own version numbering and release lifecycle.
Any similarity with Drools, jBPM or SwitchYard versions is a coincidence.

If you release the BOM, bump the hotfix version number.

== Release procedure

To mimic a release without pushing any changes:

----
$ mvn clean install
$ mvn release:prepare -DdryRun
$ mvn release:clean
----

To actually release:

----
$ mvn release:prepare
$ mvn release:perform
----

Then go to https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/[Nexus] and log in.
Find your staging repository, close it and release it.

=== Version mapping

This section records which project/product versions use which bom version.

* bom 6.1

** Not applicable yet

* bom 6.0

** Projects

*** KIE (Drools, jBPM, OptaPlanner) 6.0

** Products

*** BRMS 6.0

=== Testing
Directory `ip-bom-deps-available-test` contains simple Bash script that can be used to verify that all the dependencies
declared in `<dependencyManagement` are actually available (downloadable). The script copies the ip-bom, removes the
`<dependencyManagement>` XML elements and runs Maven build to see if all the dependencies can be resolved. If there
are dependencies not available in any of the following repositories the build will fail. Those repositories are
Maven Central, JBoss.org Nexus or Red Hat Public Product Repo.
